# Impact of Insurance Status on Hospital Readmission and Mortality Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes the performance of HOSPITAL and NEWS2 scores in predicting 30-day readmission and mortality across different insurance categories. It aims to evaluate whether these widely used risk prediction models perform consistently across diverse patient populations, with a focus on insurance status as a proxy for socio-economic factors and healthcare access.

## Key Objectives
1. Examine if HOSPITAL and NEWS2 scores predict 30-day readmission and mortality differently based on insurance status.
2. Evaluate if incorporating insurance status improves the accuracy of readmission and mortality risk prediction models.

## Data
The study uses data from UCHealth hospitals in Colorado for the year 2021, including:
- Patient demographics
- Insurance status
- HOSPITAL and NEWS2 scores
- 30-day readmission and mortality outcomes
Data cannot be accessed without permission from the University of Colorado IRB

## Methods
- Retrospective cohort study
- Logistic regression models
- Subgroup analysis by insurance category
- Model performance evaluation using AUROC, Brier scores, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV

## Key Findings
- TBD
